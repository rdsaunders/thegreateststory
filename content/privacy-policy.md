# Privacy policy

The Greatest Story Ever ("TGSE") has adopted this Privacy Policy (‘the policy’) as we recognise the right of people to keep their personal information private. The policy covers the TGSE’s use of personally identifiable information that you provide, that we collect or hold, including when you continue to browse and use this website [www.thegreateststoryever.org](https://www.thegreateststoryever.org).

## 1. Data protection

This policy explains how TGSE and the website comply with the DPA (Data Protection Act), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on 25 May 2018, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.

By providing your personal details, you agree to allow TGSE to contact you by mail, email, telephone or SMS text message in connection with the purposes of the project, either based on the consent you have given us or for our legitimate interests in accordance with current data protection regulations.

## 2. Website

If you continue to browse and use this website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use, which govern the TGSE’s relationship with you. If you disagree with any part of this policy, please do not provide personal information and do not continue to use our website.

### 2.1 Cookies policy

Cookies are small files saved to the device you are using that track, save and store information about your interactions and use of the website. We will issue cookies to your computer when you visit the website. Cookies make it easier for you to use the site during future visits. They also help monitor website traffic and personalise the site's content for you but will not store, save or collect personal information. You may set up your computer to reject cookies, although, in that case, you may not be able to use certain features on our site.

### 2.2 Site tracking

Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, understand how they find and use our web pages, and see their journey through the website.

Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could be used to personally identify you, but Google does not grant us access to this. We consider Google a third-party data processor, as outlined in section 10.

GA uses cookies, details of which can be found on Google’s developer guides. Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.

### 2.3 Links

Occasionally, TGSE may also include links to other websites which provide further information. While we link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for other sites' content or privacy practices.

### 2.4 Downloads

Any documents or files available to download from our website are provided at your own risk.

### 2.5 Social media

TGSE uses social media such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. We use these platforms to keep people informed about TGSE and promote events and services.

Unless it is material supplied or officially posted by TGSE, we do not endorse social media website(s) and have no responsibility for the content or cookies they may contain.

TGSE will not ask for passwords or personal details on social media.

## 3. How we collect information about you

We collect personal information each time you are in contact with us. For example, when you:

* visit our website
* join our mailing list
* provide your contact details in writing or by submitting a form

## 4. How we use your information

TGSE will use the personal information we collect for the purpose disclosed at the time of collection or otherwise as set out in this policy. We will not use your personal information for any other purpose without first seeking your consent unless authorised or required by law. Generally, we will only use and disclose your personal information as follows:

* to keep you informed email about activities, resources and events
* to establish and maintain your involvement with TGSE, including providing you with regular correspondence
* for promoting products or services and to keep you informed of new developments we believe may interest you. If we contact you without obtaining your prior consent, we will allow you to decline any further promotional communications.
* to answer an inquiry or request further information or complaint about TGSE, its services, activities and events.

## 5. Who sees your information

### 5.1 Where your information stored

The information you provide will be held on computers in the UK, the European Union and the USA and may be accessed by volunteers at the TGSE who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you.

Your personal information will be kept strictly confidential and held safely and securely in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.

We use cloud-based systems to process data; therefore, data may be processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We adopt the Information Commissioners approved measures and therefore ensure that personal data is held in compliance with European data protection regulations. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is stored and processed securely in accordance with this policy. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing of your information.

## 6. Sharing of your information

We will not share any information we hold about you with others without your prior consent unless one of the following exceptions applies. Information may be shared between TGSE staff or with authorised volunteers to provide services to you effectively. We may disclose the information we hold about you if:

* There is a legitimate interest for us to do so.
* It’s a necessary part of providing you with our service(s) — for example, by using a third-party mailing house to process our communications.

Where such details are shared, we have confidentiality agreements that restrict the use of your information to the purpose it is provided and ensure it is stored securely and kept no longer than necessary.

## 7. Security

TGSE will take reasonable steps to secure any personal information we hold and keep this information accurate and up to date. The Internet is not a secure method of transmitting the information. Accordingly, TGSE cannot accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for any unauthorised access or use of that information.

We take security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Your information will be held for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires or permits.

## 8. How long we hold your information for

We only keep it as long as it is reasonable and necessary for the relevant activity, whether to fulfil statutory obligations or as long as the law requires.

## 9. Your rights

As an individual, you have control over what information we hold about you, how it is used, and whether you are happy for us to keep it. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that you have:

* **Right to be informed** — to know what information we collect about you and why. This policy is in response to this right.
* **Right of access** — to see what information we hold about you and verify the lawfulness of our processing of your data.
* **Right to rectification** — to ask us to change or complete any inaccurate or incomplete personal information about you.
* **Right to erasure** — to ask us to delete your personal information where it is no longer necessary for us to use it, you have withdrawn consent, or we have no lawful basis for keeping it.
* **Right to restrict processing** — to change how we use your data.
* **Right to data portability** — to provide you or a third party with some of the personal information we hold about you in a structured, commonly used, electronic form so that it can be easily transferred.
* **Right to object** — to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
* **Right not to be subjected to automatic decision-making, including profiling** — You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions that will create legal effects or have a similar significant impact on you unless you have given us your consent. We do not currently carry out any automated decision-making.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights or make a complaint, you can contact the privacy officer at TGSE.

You can also make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority, the Information Commissioner's Office, [https://ico.org.uk/](https://ico.org.uk/ "https://ico.org.uk/").

Please note some of these rights only apply in certain circumstances, and we may not be able to fulfil every request.

## 10. Our third-party data processors

We use several third parties to process personal data on our behalf. These third parties have been carefully chosen, and all comply with the legislation in section 6.0.

* G-Suite (Privacy policy)
* Mailchimp (Privacy policy)

## 11. Changes to this policy

TGSE may amend the policy from time to time to ensure compliance with changes or amendments to the law of the UK. Any amended version will be available on our website at [www.thegreateststoryever.org](https://www.thegreateststoryever.org). Please visit our website regularly to keep up to date with any changes.
