## 5. Who sees your information

### 5.1 Where your information stored

The information you provide to us will be held on computers in the UK, the European Union and the USA and may be accessed by or given to staff at the Church who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. If the information you provide us is in paper format, then this will be stored in secure storage with restricted access.

Your personal information will be kept strictly confidential and held safely and securely in accordance with our Data Protection Policy.

We use cloud-based systems to process data and therefore data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). We adopt the Information Commissioners approved measures and therefore ensure that personal data is held in compliance with European data protection regulations. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is stored and processed securely in accordance with this policy. By submitting your personal data you agree to this transfer, storing and processing of your information.

## 6. Sharing of your information

We will not usually share any information we hold about you with others without your prior consent unless one of the following exceptions applies. Information may be shared between the Church staff or with authorised volunteers to provide services to you effectively. We may disclose the information we hold about you if:

* We feel there is a legitimate interest for us to do so.
* It is necessary for law enforcement or similar purposes.
* we need to review the quality of our services. For example, we regularly employ auditors to inspect our files and maintain high levels of security & integrity across our organisation. HMRC also have the right to review our files to ensure we are complying with their rules.
* it’s a necessary part of providing you with our service(s) or contacting you as a member or donor — for example, by using a third-party mailing house to process our communications
* it’s a necessary part of ensuring we comply with our legal obligations as a data controller — for example, sending information to HMRC for gift aid purposes

Where such details are shared, we have confidentiality agreements in place that restrict the use of your information to the purpose for which it is provided and ensure it is stored securely and kept no longer than necessary.

## 7. Security

The Church will take reasonable steps to keep secure any personal information which we hold and to keep this information accurate and up to date. The Internet is not a secure method of transmitting the information. Accordingly, the Church cannot accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for any unauthorised access or use of that information.

We take security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Your information will be held for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires or permits.

## 8. How long we hold your information for

We only keep it as long as it is reasonable and necessary for the relevant activity, which may be to fulfil statutory obligations (for example, the collection of Gift Aid) or as long as the law requires.

## 9. Your rights

As an individual, you have control over what information we hold about you, how it is used, and whether you are happy for us to keep it. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that you have:

* **Right to be informed** — to know what information we collect about you and why. This policy is in response to this right.
* **Right of access** — to see what information we hold about you and to verify the lawfulness of our processing of your data.
* **Right to rectification** — to ask us to change or complete any inaccurate or incomplete personal information held about you.
* **Right to erasure** — to ask us to delete your personal information where it is no longer necessary for us to use it, you have withdrawn consent, or where we have no lawful basis for keeping it.
* **Right to restrict processing** — to change how we use your data.
* **Right to data portability** — to provide you or a third party with some of the personal information we hold about you in a structured, commonly used, electronic form so that it can be easily transferred.
* **Right to object** — to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
* **Right not to be subjected to automatic decision-making, including profiling** — You have the right not to be subject to automated decisions that will create legal effects or have a similar significant impact on you unless you have given us your consent. We do not currently carry out any automated decision-making.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights or make a complaint, you can do so by contacting the privacy officer of the Church.

You can also make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority, the Information Commissioner's Office, [https://ico.org.uk/](https://ico.org.uk/ "https://ico.org.uk/").

Please note some of these rights only apply in certain circumstances, and we may not be able to fulfil every request.

## 10. Our third-party data processors

We use several third parties to process personal data on our behalf. These third parties have been carefully chosen and all of them comply with the legislation set out in section 6.0.

* G-Suite ([Privacy policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/policies/privacy/))
* Mailchimp ([Privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/))
