The Greatest Story Ever provides session plans that last 10-15 min based on a key character or event in the Bible. Each session is linked to a card that can be hung over a string storyline or stood up on a surface, forming a visual guide for where each story fits into the BIG picture. The card also tags to a webpage of content that provides the session plan. Scan the QR code with your mobile device or tablet to get there. Each session follows the same pattern:

1. **REVIEW IT**: ask one of the children to talk through the story so far based on the cards currently displayed on your storyline.
2. **WATCH IT**: scan the QR code to get onto the webpage and watch the video.
3. **READ IT**: this short Bible reading could be read a couple of times. We encourage you to find it in a hard copy of the Bible too.
4. **QUIZ IT**: talk through the questions on the webpage to discuss the story and how it applies to us. This should take about 5 mins so keep it moving!
5. **PRAY IT**: invite everyone to close their eyes as we turn to God. Read the prayer on the webpage. Then invite others to pray in their own words.
6. **DO IT**: read this final sentence to give a punchy application to the session
7. **PLACE IT**: Give the session card to one of the children. Ask them to read the summary on the back and then place it on the storyline with the other cards.
