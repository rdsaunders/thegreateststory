title: Who developed this resource?
order: 2

---
The Ollertons family put this resource together during the Coronavirus pandemic. We designed a session each evening and road-tested it with our three kids over breakfast (and revise… and repeat). Charlotte’s a qualified youth worker with oodles of creativity - see the paintings on the cards. Andrew is a more boring-theologian-type. He works with Bible Society and is author of [The Bible Course](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/the-bible-course/) a small group resource.
