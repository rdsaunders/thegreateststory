This is a story adventure for people to do in groups or in pairs. Learning is always more fun and memorable together. 

This is a story adventure for anyone who can sit still and chat for a while.  We think maybe age 6+. Try it out and let us know.  Our children are 8,10 & 12. They have loved it. Our friends with 6 year twins have also loved it.   

This is a story adventure for those who are totally new to the Bible and for those who have been on the journey of reading the Bible for a while.  (We've found that sometimes even for those who know the Bible all the individual elements don't always fall into place using a resource like this one!)
