What did his mother do?\n\n**Moses was brought up in the luxury of Pharaoh’s palace but he knew he didn’t belong there so he ran away and hid in the wilderness.**\n\n* What happened next?\n* What would you say to a burning bush that called your name?\n\n**God appeared to Moses because he had a mission for him.** \n\n* What was it? (v.10)\n\n_Fact: the story of God rescuing the Israelites from Egypt is called the Exodus. This word means “exit” or “way out”._\n\n* Why was God so concerned for his people? (v.7)\n\n**God is just as concerned today for those who are trapped and enslaved.**\n\n* How did Moses feel about being sent back to Egypt on a rescue mission? (v.11)\n* What did God promise him? (v.12)\n* What situations make you feel like a “nobody” or that you are not good enough?\n\n**Pause – with that in mind let’s remind ourselves that almighty God promises to be with us, just like he was with Moses.**"
read_scripture = "When the Lord saw that Moses was coming closer, he called to him from the middle of the bush and said, “Moses! Moses!”\rHe answered, “Yes, here I am.”\r\rThen the Lord said, “I have seen how cruelly my people are being treated in Egypt; I have heard them cry out to be rescued from their slave drivers. I know all about their sufferings.\r\rNow I am sending you to the king of Egypt so that you can lead my people out of his country.”\rBut Moses said to God, “I am nobody. How can I go to the king and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”\rGod answered, “I will be with you, and you will bring the people out of Egypt.” \r"
