questions = "**Because Israel continued to disobey God, he let their enemies take them to a foreign land. This is called Exile. It means living away from your home. The beginning of the book of Daniel says, “King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem and surrounded the city” (Daniel 1:1)**\n\n* Where was Daniel born and raised?\n* Where did King Nebuchadnezzar take him to live during exile?\n\n**Babylon was over 900 miles away. Everything would have been strange and different there.**\n\n* Have you ever eaten foreign food that is very different to what you are used to, or heard people speaking a foreign language that you didn’t understand?\n\n**Going on holiday abroad can be fun but exile in a foreign country is a different matter.**\n\n* How might Daniel have felt when he arrived in Babylon?\n\n**Daniel and his friends lived differently to everyone else in Babylon because they trusted God.**\n\n* What diet and food choice did Daniel and his friends ask for and why?\n* In what ways will we live differently to some of our friends if we chose to put God first?\n\n**As every sports team knows it is always harder to win away from home.  Daniel's friends got thrown into a deadly furnace and survived. Many years later some nasty people laid a trap to get rid of Daniel.**\n\n* What was their cunning plan? \n* What law did they get changed? \n* How did Daniel respond?\n\n\n* After the miracle of Daniel being saved from the lions how did the King respond? _See “Read it” Daniel 6:25-28_\n\n**When Daniel lived boldly for God in a foreign land even the Babylonian king realised God’s way was the best way.**\n\n* How can we live boldly so other people consider following God?"
