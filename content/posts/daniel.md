This is where Daniel fits in.**\n\n**The beginning of the book of Daniel says, “King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem and surrounded the city” (Daniel 1:1)**\n\nWhere was Daniel born and raised?\n\nWhere did King Nebuchadnezzar take him to live during exile?\n\nHave you ever eaten foreign food that is very different to what you are used to, or heard people speaking a foreign language that you didn’t understand?\n\n**Going on holiday abroad can be fun but exile in a foreign country is a different matter.**\n\nHow might Daniel have felt when he arrived in Babylon?\n\nWhat diet and food choice did Daniel and his friends ask for and why?\n\n**Daniel and his friends lived differently to everyone else in Babylon because they trusted God.**\n\nIn what ways will we live differently to some of our friends if we chose to put God first?\n\n**As every sports team knows it is always harder to win away from home. But**\n\n**many years later Daniel was still living God’s way and had become very successful in Babylon. This made other people jealous –**\n\nWhat was their cunning plan to try and get Daniel thrown into a den of lions?\n\n**The new law said that everyone in Babylon could only pray to King Darius.**\n\nHow did Daniel respond?\n\n**Daniel knew his decision could get him into trouble. And it did.**\n\nWhat happened next?\n\n**After the miracle of Daniel being saved from the lions how did the King respond?** See “Read it” Daniel 6:25-28\n\nWhen Daniel stayed faithful to God in a foreign land even the Babylonian king realised God’s way was the best way.\n\n**How can we live differently so other people can still see that God’s way in the best way?**"
