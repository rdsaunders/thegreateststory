Decades later exiles began to return to live in Jerusalem but the city walls were still ruined.**\n\n* Where was Nehemiah and what was he doing when he heard that Jerusalem’s walls still lay in ruins?\n* How did Nehemiah respond to this news? Nehemiah 1:4\n\n**For Nehemiah ,who was an Israelite, the state of Jerusalem reflected badly on God and his people. That is why he was so upset about the rubble.**\n\n* If someone said that God’s church is in ruin and disrepair today what would you say?\n\n_(Steer the conversation away from buildings to how healthy and active God’s people are in worshipping God and witnessing to the community around in practical ways)._\n\n* What did Nehemiah decide to do about the situation?\n* What risks did he take?\n\n**Nehemiah risked his life, gave up his job, traveled over 800 miles and used his personal resources to help rebuild Jerusalem. When he arrived, he discovered that God’s people had enemies near Jerusalem too.**\n\n* What did they do to try and stop the walls being rebuilt?\n* How did Nehemiah and the people respond?\n\n**When people work together with a plan and a clear sense of God’s favour amazing things can happen.

They sang and marched around the city walls and up to the temple.**\n\n* When have you been full of joy and celebrated something God has done?"
read_scripture = "[Nehemiah records]  Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived from Judah with another group, and I asked them about Jerusalem and about our fellow-Jews who had returned from exile in Babylonia. They told me that those who had survived and were back in the homeland were in great difficulty and that the foreigners who lived near by looked down on them. They also told me that the walls of Jerusalem were still broken down and that the gates had not been restored since the time they were burnt. When I heard all this, I sat down and wept.  For several days I mourned and did not eat. I prayed to God.\nThe Conclusion of the Work\n\nAfter 52 days of work the entire wall was finished on the 25th day of the month of Elul. When our enemies in the surrounding nations heard this, they realized that they had lost face, since everyone knew that the work had been done with God's help.\n"
