read_scripture = "Queen Esther received a message from her uncle Mordecai, who also lived in exile in Persia. It contained the following warning. \n\nIf you keep quiet at a time like this, help will come from heaven to the Jews, and they will be saved, but you will die and your father's family will come to an end. Yet who knows — maybe it was for a time like this that you were made queen!”\nEsther sent Mordecai this reply: “Go and gather all the Jews in Susa together; hold a fast and pray for me. Don't eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My young women and I will be doing the same. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. If I must die for doing it, I will die.”\n"
