questions: "**The creation story tells us that God made everything for us to enjoy.**\n\n*
  What is your favourite animal or bird?\n* What is your favourite fruit or vegetable?\n\n**God
  created time, land, seasons, light, landscapes, plants and living creatures.**\n\n*
  Of all the things God made, what was his favourite?\n\n**Once God had made people
  he said this is \"very good.\"** \n\n* How does it make you feel to know that you
  are so special to God and he loves you?\n* What do you think it means that God made
  us in his image to be like Him? Genesis 1 v.27\n\n  _(Move the conversation away
  from talking about physical characteristics.  It's more about character and values.)_\n\n**God
  made us with amazing skills and talents to fulfil a great purpose.**\n\n* What are
  you really good at doing?\n* How can you use your abilities in a way that pleases
  God?\n\n**God told Adam and Eve to care for the world that he had made for them.**\n\n*
  How can we do this? Genesis 1 v.28"
