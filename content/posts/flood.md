questions: |-
  * If you were stuck on the ark, which animal would you want to share a bedroom with and why?

  * How had the world and people changed from when God first created it?
  * Why did God choose to flood the world?

  **Noah was God’s friend, he was different to everyone else because he lived to please God.**

  * Why did God ask Noah to build an ark?
  * What did Noah’s friends and neighbours think of him building a boat?
  * When have you felt different or weird because you follow God?

  **The world was washed clean through the flood and Noah’s family was rescued in the ark.**

read_scripture: "\nWhen the LORD saw how wicked everyone on earth was and how evil
  their thoughts were all the time, he was sorry that he had ever made them and put
  them on the earth.   He was so filled with regret that he said, “I will wipe out
  these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry
  that I made any of them.”\nWhenever I cover the sky with clouds and the rainbow
  appears, I will remember my promise to you and to all the animals that a flood will
  never again destroy all living beings. \n"
