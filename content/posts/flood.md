questions: "* If you were stuck on the ark for over a year, which animal would you
  want to share a bedroom with and why?\n\n**The world has become a different place
  to the one God created. People have changed too. He can no longer say it is very
  good but he does have a plan to sort it out….**\n\n* How had the world changed from
  when God first created and said it was “very good”?\n* Why did God choose to flood
  the world?\n\n**Noah was God’s friend, he was different to everyone else because
  he lived to please God.** \n\nWhy did God ask Noah to build an ark?\n\nWhat did
  Noah’s friends and neighbours think of his building a boat?\n\nWhen have you felt
  different or weird because you follow God?\n\n**The world was washed clean through
  the flood and Noah’s family was rescued in the ark.**\n\nWhat does the rainbow mean
  for Noah and us?\n\n**As God’s friends he promises to rescue us and take care of
  us.**\n\nHow does that make you feel?"
read_scripture: "\nWhen the LORD saw how wicked everyone on earth was and how evil
  their thoughts were all the time, he was sorry that he had ever made them and put
  them on the earth.   He was so filled with regret that he said, “I will wipe out
  these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry
  that I made any of them.”\nWhenever I cover the sky with clouds and the rainbow
  appears, I will remember my promise to you and to all the animals that a flood will
  never again destroy all living beings. \n"
