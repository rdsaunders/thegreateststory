questions = "Have you ever completely changed your mind about something or someone (a football team, food, person)?\n\n**As we saw in the last session many of the religious leaders hated Jesus’ followers Saul was one of them.**\n\nWhen we first hear about Saul where is he going and why?\n\n**In some countries today there are people like Saul who try and hunt down Christians and arrest them because of their faith in Jesus.**\n\nWhat happens to Saul on the road to Damascus?\n\n**It was Jesus that stopped Saul on his deadly missions.**\n\nWhat does Jesus say to Saul?\n\n**Saul was on his way to hurt Jesus’ followers.**\n\nHowever, who does Jesus say he is actually hurting?\n\nWhat does this tell us about how close Jesus is to his followers?\n\n**Jesus met Saul in a powerful way.**\n\nHow did this impact Saul’s body?\n\nSaul was blind for three days, but for the first time he could see the truth.\n\n**What has Saul completely changed his mind about?**\n\nWhat else changed about Saul?\n\n**Saul became Paul and spent the rest of his life traveling and telling everyone he met about Jesus. He was the most influential Christian leader ever.**\n\nWhy is this a big surprise?\n\n**Saul would have been the least likely person for this task.**\n\nHow does the change in Saul inspire us not to write any one off from becoming a Jesus follower?"
read_scripture = "\n\n1In the meantime Saul kept up his violent threats of murder against the followers of the Lord.  He went to the High Priest and asked for letters of introduction to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he should find there any followers of the Way of the Lord, he would be able to arrest them, both men and women, and bring them back to Jerusalem.\n\nAs Saul was coming near the city of Damascus, suddenly a light from the sky flashed round him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?”\n\n“Who are you, Lord?” he asked.\n\n“I am Jesus, whom you persecute,” the voice said.\n"
