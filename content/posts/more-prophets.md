questions = "* Have you ever had to do any speaking or acting in public? How did you find it?\n\n**The prophets spoke and acted out God’s messages to his people. This was not an easy job!**\n\n* How did Jeremiah feel about being called to do this? Jeremiah 1:6\n* Does this remind you of character who was given tricky message for Pharoah by a burning bush?\n\n**Jeremiah thought he was too young to hear from God and speak for him.**\n\n* How did God reassure him? Jeremiah 1:5&8\n* How does it make you feel that God also wants to speak and act through you?\n\n**Have a look in the index at the front of your Bible and you will see that the whole Bible is arranged into different styles of communication. The final section is books named after prophets – from Isaiah through to Malachi. (Not including Lamentations.)**\n\n* How many are there in total?\n\n**That is a lot of prophecy!   These prophets cover hundreds of years (approx 800-400BC) and were very different types of people. Jeremiah cried a lot. Jonah had authority issues. Ezekiel had crazy visions. Hosea had relationship problems. Amos offended rich people. But together they brought one big overall message.**\n\n* What were some of the crazy things the prophets did to warn Israel what would happen if they kept disobeying God?\n\n**Ezekiel used an ancient equivalent of lego to build a model as a warning to the city of Jerusalem.  Read about this below in Ezekiel 4:1-3**\n\n_1God said, “Mortal man, get a brick, put it in front of you, and scratch lines on it to represent the city of Jerusalem. 2Then, to represent a siege \\[attack\\] , put trenches, earthworks, camps, and battering rams all round it... It is under siege, and you are the one besieging it. This will be a sign to the nation of Israel.\"_\n\n* What was going to happen to Jerusalem?\n\n**As well as these warnings prophets also gave promises of a person who would come to save them from their enemies and sin. Read what the prophet Micah said:**\n\nMicah 5:2,4-5\n\n_The LORD says, “Bethlehem... out of you I will bring a ruler for Israel, whose family line goes back to ancient times... and he will bring peace.\"_\n\n* Who is Micah talking about?\n\n**We’ve all disobeyed God but because of the Rescuer we can be forgiven and become part of God's team, like the prophets.**"
read_scripture = "The LORD said to me, “I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations.”\nI answered, “Sovereign LORD, I don't know how to speak; I am too young.”\nBut the LORD said to me, “Do not say that you are too young, but go to the people I send you to, and tell them everything I command you to say.  Do not be afraid of them, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the LORD, have spoken!”"
