questions: |-
  * How many languages can you all say “Hello” in?
  * What other languages can your friends speak?

  **The people in Babylon tried to build a great city and tower.**

  * Why did they want to do this?  (_Draw discussion towards the people’s desire to make a name for themselves and become famous_.)
  * In what ways do people show off and try to become famous in our culture?
  * How did God disrupt the Babylonian building project and why?

  **The builders in Babylon did not use their brains and hands to please God.**

  * How can we be a team with God in how we think and act this week?

  They said, “Now let's build a city with a tower that reaches the sky, so that we can make a name for ourselves and not be scattered all over the earth.”
  The city was called Babylon, because there the LORD mixed up the language of all the people, and from there he scattered them all over the earth.
