So God raised up warrior leaders, called Judges, to deliver them.**\n\n**During the time of Gideon, the Israelites forgot the wonderful things God had done for them.**\n\n* What were the consequences?\n\n**God appointed Gideon as a Judge to rescue Israel from the Midianites.**\n\n* How did Gideon reduced the size of his army?\n* If you were going to fight a battle what three things would you take with you?\n* What three things did God tell Gideon’s army to take into battle?\n\n**Gideon’s army won the battle in the most unusual way, as a trust exercise.**\n\n* What was the big lesson God wanted them to learn?\n\n**Gideon, Moses, Abraham, Noah… They all did things God’s way, even when it was risky and others didn’t get it.**\n\n* Is there anything like this that God is asking you to do?\n\n**After Gideon died, the Israelites forgot God and worshipped idols again… and again… and again... Whenever they got stuck, God raised up another Judge to rescue them – leaders like Deborah, Samson and Samuel.**\n\n**Whenever we forget God we can get stuck in negative behaviours too.**\n\n* What practically can we do to remember God’s goodness and keep him at the centre?"

What about all the wonderful things that our fathers told us the LORD used to do — how he brought them out of Egypt? The LORD has abandoned us and left us to the mercy of the Midianites.”\nThen the LORD ordered him, “Go with all your great strength and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I myself am sending you.”\n"
