Whenever they got stuck, God raised up a Judge to rescue them – leaders like Deborah, Samson and Samuel.**\n\n**Whenever we forget God we can get stuck in negative behaviour.** \n\n* How can we remember God’s goodness and keep him at the centre?"
read_scripture = "\n\nThe LORD's angel appeared to Gideon and said, “The LORD is with you, brave and mighty man!”\nGideon said to him, “If I may ask, sir, why has all this happened to us if the LORD is with us? What about all the wonderful things that our fathers told us the LORD used to do — how he brought them out of Egypt? The LORD has abandoned us and left us to the mercy of the Midianites.”\nThen the LORD ordered him, “Go with all your great strength and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I myself am sending you.”\n"
