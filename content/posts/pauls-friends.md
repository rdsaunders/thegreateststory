He had many friends and churches that he wanted to stay in touch with.**\n\n* Paul didn’t have the internet so how did he stay in touch with them?\n\n**Have a look at the index page of a Bible. Under the New Testament section you will find a list of all the letters Paul wrote from Romans to Philemon.**\n\n* How many letters is this in total? (Sometimes he wrote more than one letter to a city or person e.g. 1& 2 Corinthians)\n\n**Paul wrote to groups of Christians in cities where he had started churches. So the letters are named after cities eg. Corinth = Corinthians.**\n\n**Keep the index page of your Bible open and look at the map below.**\n\n* Can you spot four (or more) cities on the map that Paul wrote letters to?\n\n**Paul’s letters were not just postcards or chat. They include meaty teaching about what Jesus has done for us and practical coaching on how to live God’s way.**\n\n**Look back at “Read It”. This is a bit of one of Paul’s letters to the church in Corinth.**\n\n* What does Paul compare a Christian to in this passage?\n* What kind of lifestyle does an athlete live? How can this apply to us as Jesus’ followers?\n\n**Paul lived with the focus of an Olympic athlete. Later in his letter, he urges us to do the same.**\n\n“Keep busy always in your work for the Lord, since you know that nothing you do in the Lord's service is ever useless.” (1 Corinthians 15:58)\n\n* What might it mean for us to do the “work for the Lord” today? Give some practical examples?"
