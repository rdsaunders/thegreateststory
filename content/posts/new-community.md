Sharing the good news about Jesus doesn’t always go down well.**\n\n* If you talked to your friends about Jesus what sort of reactions might you get?\n\n**One of God’s angels released Peter and his friends from prison.**\n\n* What did they do next?\n\na. Run home and hide under their bed, in fear.\n\nb. Throw eggs and flour and the high priest’s house, in anger.\n\nc. Return to the temple and carry on preaching about Jesus.\n\n**Jesus’ followers were really brave and went straight back to the temple.**\n\n* Why did they think it was so important to carry on sharing about Jesus? (Acts 5:30-31)\n\n**When the religious leaders heard they had escaped from prison they were furious. They had them arrested again and demanded that they stopped talking about Jesus.**\n\n* What did Peter say in response? Acts 5:29\n\n**The Jewish leaders had them beaten up and then let them go.**\n\n* What did Jesus' followers do next?\n\na. They ran away and hid in caves in the mountains, in fear.\n\nb. Set fire to the religious leader's chariot, in anger.\n\nc. Carried on sharing the good news about Jesus.\n\n**It seems crazy that Jesus’ followers carried on sharing the good news, but they were totally convinced it was true.**\n\n* How is this a challenge for us?"

You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you want to make us responsible for his death!”\n\nPeter and the other apostles replied, “We must obey God, not men...  The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death, after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross... We are witnesses to these things.”\n"
