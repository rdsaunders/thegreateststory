Run home and hide under their bed, in fear.\n\nb. Throw eggs and flour and the high priest’s house, in anger.\n\nc. Return to the temple and carry on preaching about Jesus.\n\n**Jesus’ followers were really brave.**\n\nWhy did they think it was so important to carry on sharing about Jesus?

You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you want to make us responsible for his death!”\nPeter and the other apostles replied, “We must obey God, not men...  The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death, after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross... We are witnesses to these things.”\n"
