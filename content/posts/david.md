questions = "**After the time of the Judges, Saul became Israel’s first ever king. But he let God down. So it was time to choose a new king.**\n\n* What sorts of things do we look for when we choose a leader?\n\n**Like Samuel, we often focus on people’s wealth, profile and physical appearance.**\n\n* But what does God look for? See 1 Samuel 16:7\n\n**God chose David because he saw that his heart was good.** See 1 Samuel 16:13\n\n* What did Samuel then do to make David King?\n* What did God give David as he was anointed?\n\n**Soon after, David took some lunch to his soldier brothers.**\n\n* What happened next that made him a celebrity over night?\n* What gave David the confidence to stand up to the bully Goliath? See 1 Samuel 16:13 again\n* What challenges do we need the Holy Spirit to help us with at the moment?\n\n**After David killed Goliath, Saul became jealous**.  **Life became tough for David. He had to live in hiding for several years.**\n\n* How did David respond to his enemy Saul?\n* How should we respond to those who want to hurt us?\n\n**After Saul died, David finally became king and reigned for forty years. He was the most famous king Israel ever had. Even though David made some big mistakes, the Bible says he was a ‘man after God’s heart’ (Acts 13:22)**\n\n* What would it look like for us to be people ‘after God’s heart’?"
read_scripture = "Samuel saw Jesse's son Eliab and said to himself, “This man standing here in the LORD's presence is surely the one he has chosen.” But the LORD said to Samuel, “Pay no attention to how tall and handsome he is. I have rejected him, because I do not judge as people judge. They look at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart.”\n \n1 Samuel 16:6-7\n\n\nSamuel took the olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers. Immediately the Spirit of the LORD took control of David and was with him from that day on. \n\n1 Samuel 16:13\n"
