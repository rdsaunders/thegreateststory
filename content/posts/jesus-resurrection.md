questions = "* What is the best surprise you have ever had?\n\n**Jesus really did die on the cross. The Roman soldiers made sure of that. After he was taken down, his friends wrapped him in cloth and put him in a tomb. They rolled a big heavy stone across the door.**\n\n* Three days later when some women visited the tomb what did they discover?\n* What range of emotions do you think they felt? Why?\n\n**Jesus wasn’t a ghost or a vision. He appeared to people to prove that he was physically alive, but in a whole new way.**\n\n* From the following list who did Jesus appear to?\n\n1. The postman\n2. Pontius Pilate\n3. A crowd of 500\n4. Two men on the Emmaus Road\n5. Some women\n6. Religious leaders in the temple\n7. His friends in hiding\n8. The Roman Emperor\n\n**As hundreds of people saw, the resurrection of Jesus from the dead is not a made up fairy story but an amazing truth.**\n\n* These are some of the disciples Jesus actually appeared to. Which do you identify with the most?\n\nMary – who was full of joy when she saw Jesus was alive\n\nTwo on the road to Emmaus – who needed an explanation from the Bible\n\nDisciples hiding in fear – who needed to know Jesus was with them bringing peace\n\nThomas – who doubted it could be true until he actually saw Jesus for himself\n\n**Because Jesus is alive everything has changed.**\n\n* What great problem has Jesus defeated? And how?\n\n**We don’t need to fear death because Jesus has gone before us and is preparing a place for us after we die.**\n\n* How does that make you feel?\n\n**Because Jesus is alive and ascended to heaven we can be God’s friends.**\n\n**Before we “pray it” take a moment of quiet to ask Jesus to take away any fear of death and draw close as a friend.**"
read_scripture = "Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb, carrying the spices they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the entrance to the tomb, so they went in; but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. They stood there puzzled about this, when suddenly two men in bright shining clothes stood by them. Full of fear, the women bowed down to the ground, as the men said to them, “Why are you looking among the dead for one who is alive? He is not here; he has been raised. Remember what he said to you while he was in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, be crucified, and three days later rise to life.’ ”"
