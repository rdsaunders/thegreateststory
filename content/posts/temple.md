You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you."

questions = "King David loved to worship God and wrote many psalms. But it was his son, King Solomon, who built a vast worship arena called the Temple.\n\nWhat is the most impressive building or stadium you have ever been in?\n\nGod gave very specific instructions on how the temple should be built. How many details can you get right?\n\nHow long did the teample take to build?\n\n7 months / 7 years / 17 years\n\nWhich of these materials were not used in building the temple?\n\nCedar wood / pine wood / platinum / gold / concrete / stone\n\nHow many storeys high was the temple? 2/3/4\n\nWhat was the name of the box that was carried into the temple?\n\nNoah’s ark / the ark of the covenant / the holy vessel\n\nWhat was kept in the box?\n\nPriests clothes / Candlesticks / The 10 Commandments\n\nWhere was the box kept in the temple?\n\nOuter court / Inner court / Holy of Holies\n\nOnce the temple had been dedicated to God what came down and filled it?\n\nA flock of geese / The glory of God / Thunder and lightning\n\nThe temple was basically an enormous house. Who came to live there?\n\nWhen God’s glory filled the temple it was like he was moving in. Now the people of Israel could host God’s presence in the city of Jerusalem.\n\nSolomon and all the people would regularly came to the temple.\n\nTo do what? 1 Kings 8:20\n\nWhat made the temple so special was not its size or design but that God lived there. Now, through Jesus we can each be God’s temple because his Spirit lives in us.\n\nHow can we be good hosts of God’s presence and worship him today?"
