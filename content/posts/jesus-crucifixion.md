He wasn’t the kind of King they wanted - Jesus had not come to Jerusalem to fight the Roman army!**\n\n* What was his actual rescue mission?\n\n**In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus withdrew to pray with his friends, but one of his disciples was not there.**\n\n* Who was he and what was he up to?\n\n**After being arrested, Jesus was sent to the Roman ruler, Pilate, for questioning.**\n\n* Did Pilate think Jesus had done anything wrong?\n* So, why then did he sentence him to death?\n\n**Pilate gave in to the pressure from the crowd and handed Jesus over to be crucified by Roman soldiers. Crucifixion was a form of torture. Jesus was nailed to a wooden cross by his hands and feet and lifted up to die slowly.**\n\n* What happened to the sky as Jesus hung on the cross? Luke 23: 24-25\n\n**It went dark because Jesus was taking the horrible punishment for the bad things we have done.**\n\n* What happened to the curtain in the temple? Luke 23: 24-25\n\n**The curtain blocked the way into God’s presence. Now because of Jesus’ death the way is open for us to be God’s friends.**\n\n* When the Roman soldier saw all this, how did he respond?\n\n**Jesus was nailed to a cross for all the wrong things we have done.**\n\n* How does this show us how much God loves us?\n* How does this make you feel?"
