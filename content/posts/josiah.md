  Dear God,

  Thank you for the Bible. Thank you for all the things you teach us through it. Help us to be like the prophet Huldah who understood it and King Josiah who bravely put it into practice.

  Amen

  Josiah did what was pleasing to the Lord; he followed the example of his ancestor King David, strictly obeying all the laws of God.

  There had never been a king like Josiah before, who served the LORD with all his heart, mind, and strength, obeying all the Law of Moses; nor has there been a king like him since.
