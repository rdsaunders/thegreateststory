(Mark 2:5)\n\n**As far as Jesus is concerned the greatest gift he can give to us is forgiveness so we can become friends of God.**\n\n* How did the religious leaders respond to Jesus forgiving his sins?\n\n**The religious leaders knew that only God could forgive sins. That’s why they were so cross – because Jesus was acting like God.**\n\n* What did Jesus then do to prove that he really is God’s son? (Mark 2:12)\n\n**This story shows Jesus as the healer in two ways:**\n\n**He can heal our relationship with God by forgiving the bad things we have done.**\n\n**He can heal our bodies when we are sick or hurting.**\n\n**Take a quiet moment.**\n\n* Think of something you need to ask Jesus to forgive you for.\n* Think of someone you want to ask Jesus to heal.\n\n**Let’s bring these specific requests to God in prayer.**"
read_scripture = "A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum, and the news spread that he was at home. So many people came together that there was no room left, not even out in front of the door. Jesus was preaching the message to them when four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus. Because of the crowd, however, they could not get the man to him. So they made a hole in the roof right above the place where Jesus was. When they had made an opening, they let the man down, lying on his mat. Seeing how much faith they had, Jesus said to the paralysed man, “My son, your sins are forgiven.”\n\nWhile they all watched, the man got up, picked up his mat, and hurried away. They were all completely amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”\n"
