questions = "**The story of Ruth is set in the time of the Judges when Israel kept forgetting God.**\n\n* Ruth wasn’t part of God’s chosen family but in this story she travels to Bethlehem in Israel, why?\n* Where have you heard about Bethlehem before? Hold onto that thought!\n\n**Ruth was a great friend to Naomi. Take another look at Ruth 1v.16** \n\n* What do you think are the top characteristics of a true friend?\n* Who is your closest friend that you can rely on the most?\n\n**Back in Bethlehem Ruth and Naomi were vulnerable.**  \n\n* Who looked after them? How? Why?\n\n**The story of Ruth begins with tragedy but ends with rejoicing (Ruth 4 v.13-14)** \n\nTime someone to tell the whole story of Ruth in less than 60 seconds.\n\n**Now, let’s return to Bethlehem. Ruth and Boaz got married there and had a son called Obed. Centuries later one of their descendants was born in Bethlehem who became very famous...** \n\n* What was his name?\n\n**Boaz was the “redeemer” who rescued Ruth and brought her into God’s chosen family.**\n\n* How does Boaz show what Jesus can do for us?"

Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.\nSo Boaz took Ruth home as his wife. The LORD blessed her, and she became pregnant and had a son. The women said to Naomi, “Praise the LORD! He has given you a grandson today to take care of you. May the boy become famous in Israel! "
