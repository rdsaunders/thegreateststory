questions = "* What does your name mean? Why were you given this name (ask your parents or carers)?\n\n**In the Christmas story, angels appear to Joseph and Mary telling them what to call their special son. They give two names, which are both significant:**\n\n**Immanuel means ‘God with us’**\n\n* What does this tell us about who the baby is?\n\n**Jesus means ‘the Lord saves’**\n\n* What does this tell us about why he has come?\n\n**Because of a Roman census, Joseph and Mary had to return to his hometown.**\n\n* Where did they travel to?\n\n**Think back through the greatest story so far…Hundreds of years before Jesus the prophet Micah had foretold:**  _The LORD says, “Bethlehem… out of you I will bring a ruler for Israel, whose family line goes back to ancient times.”  Micah 5:2_\n\n* Who else lived in this town? Luke 2:4  \\[_give clues to help remember Ruth as well as David_\\]\n* Jesus is God’s Son and the saviour of the world. So what is surprising about where and how he was born?\n\n**The arrival of the greatest hero ever could have easily gone un-noticed, if it hadn’t been for the angels.   They gave their big announcement not to kings or priests but to shepherds - who were hardly VIPs at the time.**\n\n* What does this show us about God and who he cares for?\n* According to the angels why is the arrival of Jesus such good news? Luke  2:10&11\n* How is this good news for us and our world today?\n\n**Jesus did not come as a superhero. He was born like one of us.  He experienced pain, tiredness, mud, animals and family life. So remember, no matter how you are feeling you can turn to Jesus. He gets it!**"
read_scripture = "Joseph went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea, the birthplace of King David. Joseph went there because he was a descendant of David. He went to register with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him. She was pregnant, and while they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to have her baby. She gave birth to her first son, wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger — there was no room for them to stay in the inn.\n\nThe shepherds and the angels -\n\nThere were some shepherds in that part of the country who were spending the night in the fields, taking care of their flocks. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone over them. They were terribly afraid, but the angel said to them, “Don't be afraid! I am here with good news for you, which will bring great joy to all the people. This very day in David's town your Saviour was born — Christ the Lord!\""
