questions = "**On Palm Sunday, Jesus made a triumphal entrance into Jerusalem. It’s the start of the biggest week in history, which we celebrate at Easter.**\n\n* What’s the biggest crowd you have ever been in? What were they celebrating?\n\n**The prophets not only promised the Rescuer would be born in Bethlehem, they also predicted his triumphal entry into the capital. Read Zechariah 9:9.**\n\n* In what ways was this prophecy fulfilled on Palm Sunday?\n\n_Shout for joy, you people of Jerusalem!_\n\n_Look, your king is coming to you!_\n\n_He comes triumphant and victorious,_\n\n_but humble and riding on a donkey._\n\n**Jerusalem was bursting with people celebrating the festival of Passover.**\n\n* Remember back to Moses – what was the first Passover all about? (Revisit the story line.)\n\n**When Jesus was baptised, John pointed to him and said, “Look, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.” Three years later, Jesus now arrives in Jerusalem at Passover. (This timing is not a co-incidence.)**\n\n* What do you think Jesus is preparing to do and why?\n* How did the crowd celebrate the arrival of Jesus?\n* Who did the crowd declare Jesus to be?\n\n**Jesus deliberately chose to ride, not on a warhorse, but on a donkey, which was an animal known for its gentleness and humility.**\n\n* How does this show Jesus is a different kind of King?\n\n**Many in the crowd welcomed Jesus. However, some of the religious leaders rejected him because they didn’t want him as their king. Still today not everyone wants to follow Jesus.**\n\n* Why do some people reject him?\n* In what ways can we welcome Jesus and celebrate him like the crowds did?"
read_scripture = "As he rode on, people spread their cloaks on the road.\nWhen he came near Jerusalem, at the place where the road went down the Mount of Olives, the large crowd of his disciples began to thank God and praise him in loud voices for all the great things that they had seen: “God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory to God!”\nThen some of the Pharisees in the crowd spoke to Jesus. “Teacher,” they said, “command your disciples to be quiet!”\nJesus answered, “I tell you that if they keep quiet, the stones themselves will start shouting.”\n"
