He wanted Jesus to become famous.**\n\n* How can we be living signposts that point to Jesus?"
read_scripture = "\n\nJohn said to the crowds …\n\n\"I baptise you with water, but he [the one who is coming] will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.”\n\nNot long afterwards Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, he saw heaven opening and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my own dear Son. I am pleased with you.”\n"
