read_scripture = "\n\nJohn said to the crowds …\n\n\"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”\nNot long afterwards Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, he saw heaven opening and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my own dear Son. I am pleased with you.”\n"
