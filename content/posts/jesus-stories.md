One brother loved spending money.**\n\n* If you had one million pounds what would you spend it on?\n\n**Surprisingly, the father gave an early inheritance to his son. He left home.**\n\n* What happened next?\n* What lessons can we learn about money and happiness from the younger son’s experience?\n\n**The younger son reached a desperate and smelly place, feeding pigs.**\n\n* If you were the father, how would you have responded to the son trying to come home? Why?\n* Using three words how would you describe the father?\n\n**In the parable, the father represents God.**\n\n* What does his response to the younger son show us about what God is like?\n\n**The older brother felt angry that the younger brother had been let off the hook.**\n\n* When are we tempted to feel like that?\n* Choose one word to describe each brother.\n\n**In the parable, if the father represents God, we are like one of the two brothers.**\n\n* Which are you most like and why?"
read_scripture = "Jesus went on to say, “There was once a man who had two sons. The younger one said to him, ‘Father, give me my share of the property now’... He went to a country far away, where he wasted his money in reckless living... At last he came to his senses and said, ‘All my father's hired workers have more than they can eat, and here I am about to starve! I will get up and go to my father and say, \"Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer fit to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired workers.\"' So he got up and started back to his father.\nHe was still a long way from home when his father saw him; his heart was filled with pity, and he ran, threw his arms round his son, and kissed him.\"\n"
