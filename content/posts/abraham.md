questions = "**God promised Abraham a massive family that, in time, would bless the whole world.**\n\n* Question:  Which do you think there are more of – grains of sand on the beaches or stars in the universe?   Answer:  Scientists estimate that there are even more stars then sand. Wow!\n* To receive what God had promised, where did Abraham and Sarah need to go and what did they leave behind?\n\n**When Abraham and Sarah moved to the land of Canaan they showed how much they trusted God.**\n\n* Have you or your family had to do something risky to follow God’s call?\n\n**Part of trusting God is waiting, but that’s not easy.**\n\n* Can you remember how old Abraham was when God first promised him a family? How old was he when Isaac finally arrived?\n* How did all that waiting make them feel?\n\n**Baby Isaac reminds us that God always keeps his promises and brings laughter into our lives.**\n\n* Are there any promises that you and your family can trust God for?\n\n**Centuries after baby Isaac, Jesus was born as a descendant of Abraham.**\n\n* How does this fulfill the massive promise God first made to Abraham? (Remember: Genesis 12:3 \"Through you I will bless all the nations.\")"
