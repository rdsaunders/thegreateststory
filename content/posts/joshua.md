questions = "* What would be your favourite place to live on planet earth and why?\n\n**God rescued Israel from slavery in Egypt, led them through the wilderness to the edge of Canaan. In the Bible this is called the Promised Land. Twelve spies went in to check it out for 40 days and came back with a report.**\n\nWhat made it such a great place to live?\n\nWhat challenges would they face moving in?\n\n**So the land was full of big grapes but also big giants. Now Israel had a choice to make.**\n\n* How many spies were afraid and said we cannot enter the land?\n* What were the names of the two spies who trusted God? (14 v.6)\n\n**Fear took over the Israelites’ hearts and stopped them from trusting God and enjoying the Promised Land.**\n\n* What situations make you feel nervous and intimidated?\n* How can fear and worry stop us living a full life if we let it take over?\n\n**Joshua and Caleb saw the giants and would also have felt nervous.** \n\n* But what did they understand that gave them total confidence? (14v. 8-9)\n\n**40 years later, Joshua finally led the next generation of Israelites into the Promised Land. They took down the giants and tucked into the grapes.**\n\n* Why is life so much better if we put our confidence in God and step out in faith?"

If the LORD is pleased with us, he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land. Do not rebel against the LORD and don't be afraid of the people who live there. We will conquer them easily. The LORD is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them; so don't be afraid.” "
