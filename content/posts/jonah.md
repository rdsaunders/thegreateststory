read_scripture = "One day the LORD spoke to Jonah son of Amittai. He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it; I am aware how wicked its people are.” Jonah, however, set out in the opposite direction in order to get away from the LORD. He went to Joppa, where he found a ship about to go to Spain. He paid his fare and went aboard with the crew to sail to Spain, where he would be away from the LORD. \n\nThen the LORD ordered the fish to spew Jonah up on the beach, and it did.\n\nOnce again the LORD spoke to Jonah. 2He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to the people the message I have given you.” \n"
