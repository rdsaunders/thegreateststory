Remember the Ninevites were Israel’s enemies!\n\n**God called Jonah on a challenging mission to share His message with the Ninevites. He was frightened and ran away.**\n\n* What might God call us to do for Him that is challenging?\n\n**Jonah got on a boat and went somewhere else.**\n\n* In what ways do we avoid doing what God asks us to do?\n\n**Even though Jonah turned his back on God. He was given a second chance.**\n\n* What three things did God use to get Jonah back to Nineveh?\n\n**God forgave Jonah and then used him to bring good news to Nineveh.**\n\n* What was his message and how did the Ninevites respond?\n\n**Through Jesus we have a message of good news.**\n\n* How can we share this with others?"
read_scripture = "One day the LORD spoke to Jonah son of Amittai. He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it; I am aware how wicked its people are.” Jonah, however, set out in the opposite direction in order to get away from the LORD. He went to Joppa, where he found a ship about to go to Spain. He paid his fare and went aboard with the crew to sail to Spain, where he would be away from the LORD. \n\nThree days later...\n\nThen the LORD ordered the fish to spew Jonah up on the beach, and it did.\n\nOnce again the LORD spoke to Jonah. He said, “Go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to the people the message I have given you.” \n"
